    <h1>Yoriichi Tsugikuni</h1>
    
    <p class="Texto1"><img src="Yoriichi_child.jpg" id="Yor_1">Yoriichi and his twin brother, Michikatsu, 
        were born into the Tsugikuni clan within the middle of the 
        Sengoku period, a time when twins were considered to be an 
        extremely bad omen. Yoriichi in particular was born with an 
        odd birthmark on his forehead, which caused his father to declare 
        that he would kill him; however, their mother Akeno flew into a rage 
        and stopped him. It was eventually agreed upon that Yoriichi would be 
        sent to a temple to become a monk when he turned ten years old.[1] 
        Despite their father's belief that the mark was unlucky, it actually 
        granted Yoriichi incredible physical prowess and the ability to see the 
        bodies of living things in transparency. Yoriichi grew up very differently 
        from Michikatsu, being given much poorer food and education than his 
        brother and confined to a small three-tatami room away from the rest 
        of the house. He never spoke and was thought to be deaf as a result. 
        Akeno subsequently made him Hanafuda charm earrings in the hopes the 
        gods would bless him with the ability to speak. He also was frequently 
        seen clutching his mother's side; because of this, Michikatsu found him 
        pitiful. Still, his brother often snuck behind their father's back to 
        see Yoriichi, even giving him a handmade flute as a gift to 
        comfort him.</p>

    <p>One day, when he was seven, Yoriichi smiled and spoke for the 
        first time, declaring his intent to become a samurai like his 
        brother after watching Michikatsu practice sword swings, 
        startling him. However, Michikatsu was dismissive of this 
        sentiment as it was well-known that Yoriichi would be sent 
        to the temple when he was ten. Still, one of their father's men 
        tasked with training Michikatsu decided to humor Yoriichi, 
        showing him a simple stance. Unexpectedly, the young boy flew 
        into action after assuming the stance, landing four blows 
        against the man and shocking his brother, who despite his 
        training had never landed one. However, Yoriichi couldn't 
        stand the feeling of hitting someone and renounced his goal 
        to become a samurai. Michikatsu often asked him about how he 
        managed to hit the man and he described what was likely an 
        early form of a Breathing Style. Rather than talk about the 
        sword and continue training, he happily told Michikatsu he 
        would rather play ban-sugoroku board games and fly kites with
        him instead.</p>

    <img src="Yor_4.JPG"  id="Yor_4">

    <p>When their mother passed away from her illness, Yoriichi 
        went to Michikatsu's room at night to tell his brother the 
        news and bid farewell, planning to leave for the temple that 
        night. He expressed gratitude towards his brother, stating 
        that he would always keep him in mind and fondly tucked away 
        the flute Michikatsu had made for him earlier. It was later 
        revealed to Michikatsu through their mother's diary that 
        Yoriichi had known everything about their mother's illness, 
        how it weakened her left side and Yoriichi's frequent attempts 
        to support her and help her move around. It was also revealed 
        that Yoriichi knew his father would make him his heir and send 
        Michikatsu to the temple, ran away to spare his brother. 
        Despite this kind act, Michikatsu developed an intense hatred 
        and envy of Yoriichi for continuing to surpass him in everything 
        and continually showing gratitude to gain seemingly nothing.</p>
        
    <img src="Yor_uta2.JPG"  id="Yor_5">

    <p>Yoriichi ran away from the house and didn't stop. After 
        running straight for one day and one night without any 
        sign of exhaustion into the mountains, Yoriichi met a 
        girl around the same age as him named Uta, whose entire 
        family had died. Yoriichi chose to live with her and 
        after 10 years, Uta and Yoriichi had married: the former 
        becoming pregnant later. Just before the expected arrival, 
        Yoriichi left home to summon a midwife, promising his wife 
        to be back before the sun set. On his way, Yoriichi had 
        helped an old man and lost so much time that he decided to 
        return home and summon a midwife the next day. By then the 
        sun had already set: when he finally arrived home he found 
        that Uta and the unborn child were killed by a demon. 
        The tragedy shocked Yoriichi so much that he held her 
        corpse in his arms for ten days straight and only buried 
        them after a pursuing Demon Slayer encouraged him to do so. 
        This led Yoriichi to pick up his blade again and train as a 
        Demon Slayer.</p>

    <img src="Yor_uta1.jpg"  id="Yor_6">
    
    <P>Aided by his Demon Slayer Mark and innate talent for 
        swordsmanship, Yoriichi proved to be an incredibly powerful 
        Demon Slayer. He reunites with Michikatsu after the latter's 
        samurai encampment was slaughtered by a demon and he was left 
        the sole survivor; Yoriichi killed the creature effortlessly 
        and apologized for the deaths of his brother's comrades. 
        Aided by his breathing technique, later named Sun Breathing, 
        and wanting to help others, Yoriichi tried to teach it to the 
        other Demon Slayers. However, no one could match his form exactly. 
        Undaunted, he modified the breathing techniques to suit their 
        strengths, allowing them to gain a similar increase in power 
        and abilities to help them hunt demons. The variations he 
        created formed the first Water, Wind, Flame, Stone and Thunder 
        Breathing techniques and the best of these Demon Slayers became 
        known as the Hashira. Michikatsu himself tried and failed to 
        learn Sun Breathing, instead creating his own style he named Moon 
        Breathing.</P>

        <img src="Yor_muzan1.jpg"  id="Yor_7">

    <p>Soon, Yoriichi encounters Muzan Kibutsuji, the progenitor demon 
        and mortal enemy of the Demon Slayers, accompanied by Tamayo. 
        Upon meeting him, Yoriichi felt his rampant malicious intent, 
        likening it boiling magma from a volcano ready to consume everything. 
        It was then he reasoned he was born with the skills and talent 
        to defeat Muzan once and for all. Muzan stated that he had lost 
        interest in swordsmen who employ breathing techniques and performed 
        long sweeps of his arms to outright kill Yoriichi. He dodged them, 
        but instantly realized any of those attacks would be fatal and felt 
        fear for the first time. Seeing into the Transparent World, 
        Yoriichi discerned Muzan had seven hearts and five brains that 
        change position within his body. Seeing his chance, he combined 
        all his forms into a single attack, cutting through them all and 
        overpowering Muzan completely.</p>

        <img src="Yor_muzan2.png"  id="Yor_8">



    <p>Muzan was left in disbelief at his inability to regenerate while 
        struggling to keep his head attached. Yoriichi asked him what he 
        felt was the value of life but didn't receive an answer. 
        He turned to Tamayo, but was surprised to see her looking at 
        her master's dismembered body with a hopeful gleam in her eyes. 
        Moving to kill him once and for all, Yoriichi instead heard the 
        sound of teeth cracking as Muzan's body burst into hundreds of 
        small pieces. Caught off-guard, he was only able to destroy 1,500 
        of the 1,800 pieces, leaving the rest to escape for Muzan to 
        regenerate again. In spite of Yoriichi's failure to kill him, 
        Muzan never forgot the encounter and remained fearful of Yoriichi 
        for the rest of his life.</p>

        <img src="Yor_muzan3.JPG"  id="Yor_9">


    <p>Tamayo was left on the verge of tears as she realized Muzan 
        learned how to avoid death by decapitation, cursing the survival 
        of the man that ruined her life. Upon realizing the Kibutsuji
        curse failed due to Muzan being weakened so much, Tamayo was 
        surprised. Yoriichi approached her, but he didn't immediately 
        attack. Tamayo decided to tell him everything he needed to know 
        about Muzan and it was unlikely he would ever meet him again. 
        As thanks for her aid, he let her go free, telling her he had 
        faith in her will to end Muzan. Soon after this, several Demon 
        Slayers came to report to Yoriichi that his brother had betrayed 
        the organization, becoming a demon and assassinating the Oyakata.
        Yoriichi took responsibility for Michikatsu's betrayal, 
        his inability to kill Muzan, and letting Tamayo escape.
        The other Demon Slayers demanded he kill himself as penance, 
        but the newly appointed Oyakata ordered he be spared and 
        allowed him to leave in banishment.</p>

        <img src="Yor_banished.jpg"  id="Yor_10">

    <p>After his banishment, Yoriichi decided he had much on his mind 
        and wanted someone to talk to. He could only picture his friends 
        Sumiyoshi and Suyako and decided to visit them. He meets Sumiyoshi, 
        sat down with him, and told him his entire story, from his beginning 
        to his banishment from the Demon Slayers. Reminded of his tragedies 
        and speaking of his regret at letting Muzan live and the countless 
        death that would follow, Yoriichi grew despondent. Sumire arrives at
        that moment to ask for a hug. At Sumiyoshi's request, he lifts her
        up, making her laugh and squeal with joy, causing him to break 
        down in tears and embrace her. Suyako arrives shortly after to 
        comfort him and treat Yoriichi to a meal and cheer him up.</p>


        <img src="Yor_tears.jpg"  id="Yor_11">

        
    <p>While with the Kamados, Yoriichi would be asked by Suyako to perform 
        the Sun Breathing's forms. He kindly did so, performing all the moves 
        with such grace, he was likened more as a spirit that a human. 
        Sumiyoshi would watch these demonstration intently and keep them 
        in his memories. On his last visit, despite being told he was welcome 
        at any time, Yoriichi gave Sumiyoshi his Hanafuda earrings. Sumiyoshi 
        and Suyako realized then this was going to be the last time he would 
        visit. Overcome with emotion, Sumiyoshi called out to Yoriichi as he 
        walked away, telling him to stop saying that he was a man of no worth.
        He reminded him that he saved them and promised to preserve the Sun
        Breathing's forms through his descendants. Hearing this, Yoriichi 
        turns and smiles brightly, thanking the Kamados and waving them 
        farewell. Despite being banished from the Corps, Yoriichi would 
        continue hunting demons independently, but he kept in touch with 
        the Hashira he befriended with silent permission from the Oyakata. 
        Meanwhile, the Corps itself fell into disarray: Muzan killed every 
        other Sun Breather and no one could teach Breathing Styles as well 
        as Yoriichi.</p>

    <P>Despite the apparently limited lifespan of 25 years suffered by 
        those who bore the Demon Slayer Mark, Yoriichi lived to his 80's 
        but eventually went blind. On the last day of his life, he would 
        personally confront Michikatsu, now known as Kokushibo and Muzan's 
        strongest lieutenant as Upper Rank One. Devastated at what his 
        brother had become, he cried, and Kokushibo could only show disgust 
        that his younger brother was old but still alive despite having the 
        mark. In spite of his love for him, Yoriichi knew he had to kill him
         and prepared to strike.</P>

         <img src="Yor_dead.jpg"  id="Yor_16">


    <p>Kokushibo's disgust turned to fear upon seeing that Yoriichi still 
        was the same capable and powerful warrior from before. He told his
        brother when he was to attack and soon struck, slicing through his 
        neck without Kokushibo able to even draw his blade. Angered at being
        surpassed again, Kokushibo waited for the next attack. Unfortunately,
        it never came; Yoriichi passes from old age untouched. Angered that
        his one chance at a fair battle is gone and the man who nearly 
        killed Muzan and him is now dead and undefeated forever, Kokushibo
        would strike at his brother's corpse in scorn, only to realize 
        Yoriichi carried the flute he gifted to him when they were both 
        still children. Unable to sever his connection with Yoriichi,
        Kokushibo took the split flute and carried it with him.</p>
